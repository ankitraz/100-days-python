# short hand if else - used to write if else in a single line

a = 45
b = 34

print("A") if a > b else print("=") if a==b else print("B")



# we can also use it to assign variable values

c = 9 if a < b else 0
print(c)


# the shorthand syntax can be convenient to write simple if-else statements, especially when you 
# want to assign a value to a variable based on a conditin. However, it is not suitable for more complex situations
