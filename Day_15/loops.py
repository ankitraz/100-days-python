# for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string). 

# var = "Ankit"
# for i in var:
#     print(i, " ")



# for i in range(0,5,2):
#     print("Hello world")


# a = 10
# while a>6:
#     print("Hello world")
#     a-=1


# nested for loop


# find the sum of all the number in the list
# num = [2,4,5,67,7]
# _sum = 0
# for i in num:
#     _sum += i
# print(_sum)


# # using continue keyword in forloop

# num = [1,4,56,7,8]
# for i in num:
#     if i == 7:
#         continue   # it will skip 7
#     print(i)



# # pass keyword
# for i in range(5):
#     pass  # it means you want to write some code later on. and still want next block of code to be executed.
# print("This statement is printed after pass.")


# colors = ["red","green","blue"]
# for i in colors:
#     print(i)
#     for j in i:
#         print(j)


# range function
